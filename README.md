# 🕹️ Cuberbash Nostalgic Games Collection

A collection of classic browser games built with **JavaScript**, assembled as part of my entry for the **Cuberbash** competition at **Skool**. This project is all about revisiting nostalgic games we grew up playing—reimagined for the web.

> ❗ I did **not create all of these games from scratch**. This is a curated collection brought together to showcase the spirit of retro gaming using modern web technologies.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project was created for the **Cuberbash** event to bring together multiple nostalgic games under one roof. It's a celebration of childhood favorites and a personal challenge to explore how these games can be implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
